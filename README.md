WHAT TO DO WE OFFER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a brief outline of what we want to serve to our audience
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Current Weather:

Here we provide our followers with all the useful information 
about today's weather absolutely free. In particular, the 
important points of the day such as temperature, wind speed, 
amount of rain, sunsets time etc. are arranged at that particular 
section. From where we all can know about the state of our nature 
and take proper action when needed.

Global Location:

When we see something at eye level we understand it better, so 
with that in mind here is the world map. Temperature, wind 
current, cloud position etc. are all understood by this map. 
And there is also a map of a particular place but it is available 
only if you subscribe to us. Also, the map used by the public 
provides weather forecasts for the entire world.

Weekly Forecast:

Basically we provide our audience with the information about the 
upcoming 6 days weather of given location, where a beautiful 
line-graph is given of the average temperature of those 6 days. 
Since the weather changes at any time, it is not always possible 
to provide accurate information for all places, so the average 
temperature information is given based on long-term research.

Ozone Forecast:

We all know the importance of ozone gases in our earth's 
atmosphere. So we need to know the changes in ozone gas level 
due to constant pollution so that we can be aware. So this ozone 
gas data is interpreted with historical events and some data of 
the previous month. So this whole thing is shown here with some 
pictures and illustrations which will change from time to time.

Environment Quiz:

Here is a very nice and informative quiz present. The main reason 
for its existence is to increase public awareness towards the 
environment So that everyone can think about the good and bad of 
the environment to make our world more beautiful. Sometimes special 
quizzes are organized where certificates are given to those who win 
that quiz.

About WHITE LOTUS:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, it is better to say that our WHITE LOTUS was 
established in 14 February 2023. So it didn't take us long for 
this team to come into existence. There were many reasons behind 
the establishment of this WHITE LOTUS but let me tell you the main 
reasons The reason one 1 is that by presenting enviorment science 
in front of everyone through this weather app, everyone can gain 
knowledge on nature theory in a scientific way by searching tricks. 

Therefore, all the details of the current green science are 
highlighted in the various social media platforms of this 
organization. From newly formed weather, ozone status, future 
technologies, we have everything we share with you. Not only 
this, with the help of this small team of scientists we have been 
able to present special events in green event(like: blood donation, 
tree planting, etc) our listeners. So we are making this website for
many needs and requests of our audience so thatthey can keep an eye 
on all our knowledge from one place. The next reason is that, we 
have the greentech fest in our collage and our topic is made website 
where we show the current weather and green related quiz.
